Welcome to the Search Engine Aggregator
=================================

This search aggregator project combines the search results of three top search engines: Google, Yahoo and Bing.

To run a query, simply invoke this web service like so: http://localhost:9000/search/<your search term here>

The returned result will be a JSON array of search result titles and their corresponding URLs.

To run this application:

1. To run the activator shell script, you will need to make it executable, so run: chmod +x activator
3. Run: activator run
4. Activator should now download all the required dependencies and start the application when it's done.
